## About the project
We propose an efficient approach to generate identifiable faces from voice alone. Our architecture utilizes eigenfaces, obtained through PCA on aligned face images, to create faces of different identities. 
By representing faces as eigenvalue vectors multiplied by eigenface vectors, we achieve improved efficiency without compromising the ability to generate identifiable features.
